## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Setup:

### Issue #1: Authentication Error ✅
**Problem:** "Authentication required" error when searching
**Solution:** Temporarily disabled authentication requirement for testing without OAuth

### Issue #2: Fetch Not Working ✅
**Problem:** `TypeError: fetch is not a function`
**Solution:** Removed `node-fetch` import and used Node v22's native fetch

### Issue #3: API Route Mismatch ✅
**Problem:** Client and server routes didn't match
**Solution:** Changed server to accept `POST /api/search` with body

### Issue #4: Database Integration ✅
**Problem:** Top searches and history returned empty arrays
**Solution:** Implemented MongoDB operations for saving and retrieving searches
